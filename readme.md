# [Capstone] 2019 IMdB Webscrapping with BeautifulSoup

This is a beginner and a simple project about scrapping a 2019 IMdB hit movie database using both BeautifulSoup and Flask. This project is intended for the Data Analytics Course completion in Algorit.ma, Jakarta.

This might be the beginning and perhaps I will soon add more in here repisotory...

PS: There are 2 files: The .py is the code for the websrapping project, the .png is the graphic visualization of the IMdB dataframe
